## What is MapStudy?

MapStudy is an integrated, modularized framework for the creation of survey applications designed to test cartographic design and interaction hypotheses in a modern web map environment. It leverages Postgresql and PHP on the server side and Javascript, jQuery, Leaflet, and D3 on the client. MapStudy is being developed specifically for use in the University of Wisconsin-Madison Cartography program through the support of the UW-Madison Cartography Lab and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.

## What is the status of MapStudy?

MapStudy is currently in very preliminary form and will not be ready for release until at least February, 2016.

## Where are the Docs?

Sit tight&mdash;once the project has reached beta status, the documentation on setup and configuration of MapStudy will be posted here and/or on a separate site to be determined.
